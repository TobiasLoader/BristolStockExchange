Graphical Stock Exchange

The aim of this project was to create a graphical interface in the form of a web app for an open-source financial exchange simulation called BSE â€“ a programme developed in 2012 by Prof D Cliff of Bristol University Computer Science Department [Insert Link to the BSE Repo Page?]. 

The original python was manually translated into P5.js to enable integration with a purpose built GUI featuring customisable input options and interactive animated graphs to display data output.
